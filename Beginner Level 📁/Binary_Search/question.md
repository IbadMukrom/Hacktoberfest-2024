You are given a sorted array of integers. Write a Python program that takes an integer key as input and performs a binary search to find the key in the array. The program should:

Ask the user for the number of elements in the array.
Allow the user to input the elements of the array.
Prompt the user to input the key they want to search for.
Implement the binary search algorithm to search for the key.
If the key is found, print the index where the key is located in the array.
If the key is not found, print a message saying the key is not in the array.
